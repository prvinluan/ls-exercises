# In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

# sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

# Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals 'visible'.

# ANSWER:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

if sun == 'visible'
  puts "The sun is so bright!"
end

# DISCUSSION:

# For us to print the string 'The sun is so bright!' when sun equals 'visible', we can
# use an if statement that checks if sun is equal to 'visible' by using the equality operator.
