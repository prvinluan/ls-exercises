# In the code below, boolean is randomly assigned as true or false.

# boolean = [true, false].sample

# Write a ternary operator that prints "I'm true!" if boolean equals true and prints "I'm false!" if boolean 
# equals false.

# ANSWER:

boolean = [true, false].sample

puts boolean ? "I'm true!" : "I'm false!"

# DISCUSSION:

# Using the given code above, we are asked to write a ternary statement that prints two different strings
# based on the random value boolean is assigned to. A ternary statement is a simple and concise if statement
# that takes in three arguments - a condition and two possible outcomes. It uses an ? and a :.
