# Using the following code, select the value 'blue' from car and print it with #puts.

# car = {
#   type:    'sedan',
#   color:   'blue',
#   year:    2003
# }

# ANSWER:

car = {
  type:    'sedan',
  color:   'blue',
  year:    2003
}

puts car[:color]

# We can retrieve a value from a hash by placing it's key between [], hash[:key].
