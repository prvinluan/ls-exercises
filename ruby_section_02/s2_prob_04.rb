# PROBLEM 4
# Use the dates from the previous example and store them in an array. 
# Then make your program output the same thing as exercise 3.

# Array for each movie's year
year = [1995, 1993, 1992, 1988, 1997]

# Print each year in the array
year.each {| y | puts y }

# ------
# ANSWER
# year = dates = [1975, 2004, 2013, 2001, 1981]
# puts dates[0]
# puts dates[1]
# puts dates[2]
# puts dates[3]
# puts dates[4] 

# NOTE: PRACTICE CONCEPT OF ACCESS INDEX!
