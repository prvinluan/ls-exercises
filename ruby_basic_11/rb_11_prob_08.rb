# The following array contains three names and numbers. Group each name with the number following it by placing the pair 
# in their own array. Then create a nested array containing all three groups. What does this look like? (You don't need 
# to write any code here. Just alter the value shown so it meets the exercise requirements.)

# ['Dave', 7, 'Miranda', 3, 'Jason', 11]

# ANSWER:

[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

# DISCUSSION:

# Arrays are data structures that stores items in an ordered index, it is enclosed by [] and comma separated. Arrays
# can contain same or different data types, and even nest other arrays called multi-dimensional arrays.
