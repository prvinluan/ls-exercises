# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  puts 'Dinner'
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal

# ANSWER:

# Dinner
# Breakfast

# DISUSSION:

# The above code contains a method definition with the name meal, and prints the string 'Dinner' and returns
# a value of 'Breakfast'. When we invoke on meal and print it's return value, 'Dinner' is the first output
# printed from within the method followed by 'Breakfast' when we use puts to print the return value for #meal
