# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal

# ANSWER:

# Evening

# DISCUSSION:

# The code above defines a method called meal, where in the string value 'Evening' is returned.
# "Evening" is implicitly returned, meaning the reserved word return is not necessary to return
# a value in a method definition.
