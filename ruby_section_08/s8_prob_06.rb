# PROBLEM 6:
# Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

# my_hash has the symbol x as the key to the value "some value"
# my_hash2 has the variable x as the key to the value "some value"
# since x is assigned the string value "hi there", the second hash is the same
# as the string "hi there" is the key to "some value"
