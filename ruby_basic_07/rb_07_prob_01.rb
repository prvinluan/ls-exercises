# Write a method named print_me that prints I'm printing within the method! when invoked as follows:

# print_me

# ANSWER:

def print_me
  puts "I'm printing within the method!"
end

print_me

# DISCUSSION:

# line 1: a method print_me is defined
# line 2: the method outputs a string message using puts
# line 3: end denotes the methods completion
# line 5: method print_me is invoked, will output the message "Im printing within the method!"
